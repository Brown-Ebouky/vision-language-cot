One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.

The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung. Figure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel. a large parachute suspended from the ceiling of a building Options: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour Solution: Answer:",

        "Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece? Choose the most likely ratio. Context: This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep: The fleece, or outer coat, of a sheep is often cut off and used to make yarn for fabrics and other textiles. Woolly fleeces, which have shorter hairs, are usually used for clothing and blankets. Hairy fleeces, which have longer hairs, are usually used for carpets. In a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f). This Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep. The image depicts a square grid with four squares, each containing the letter \"f\" in blue. The squares are arranged in a 2x2 configuration, with two squares on the top row and two squares on the bottom row. Each square contains the letter \"f\" in a different font style, making it easy to distinguish them from one another. Additionally, there are several smaller blue f's scattered throughout the grid, further emphasizing the presence of the letter \"f\". Options: (A) 0:4 (B) 4:0 (C) 2:2 (D) 1:3 (E) 3:1 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a woolly fleece or a hairy fleece, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for a hairy fleece, is dominant over the f allele, which is for a woolly fleece.nA woolly fleece is the dominant allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the fleece type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a woolly fleece must have the genotype FF or Ff.nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.nA hairy fleece is the recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the fleece type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a hairy fleece must have the genotype ff.nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with a woolly fleece. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with a hairy fleece. Answer:",

        "Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with smooth fruit to offspring with fuzzy fruit? Choose the most likely ratio. Context: In a group of tomato plants, some individuals have smooth fruit and others have fuzzy fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for fuzzy fruit (f). This Punnett square shows a cross between two tomato plants. The image depicts a grid of four squares, with each square containing the letter \"f\" in blue. The squares are arranged in a 2x2 matrix, with two squares on the top row and two squares on the bottom row. Each square contains the letter \"f\" in blue, making it clear that this is a representation of the Fibonacci sequence. The squares are positioned in a way that makes it easy to read and understand the Fibonacci sequence, which is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Options: (A) 3:1 (B) 2:2 (C) 1:3 (D) 4:0 (E) 0:4 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with smooth fruit or fuzzy fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for smooth fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for fuzzy fruit.nSmooth fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A tomato plant with the dominant version of the fruit texture trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with smooth fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.nFuzzy fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit texture trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with fuzzy fruit must have the genotype ff.nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with smooth fruit to offspring with fuzzy fruit is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with smooth fruit. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with fuzzy fruit. Answer:",

        "Question: Based on this information, what is Blossom's phenotype for the coat color trait? Context: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). Blossom is a horse from this group. Blossom has the homozygous genotype ll for the coat color gene. Options: (A) a black coat (B) a reddish-brown coat Solution: Blossom's genotype for the coat color gene is ll. Blossom's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for a reddish-brown coat. So, Blossom's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a reddish-brown coat.nTo check this answer, consider whether Blossom's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.nBlissom's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles.

        "Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body? Choose the most likely ratio. Context: In a group of rats, some individuals have a normal-sized body and others have a dwarf body. In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele for a dwarf body (b) is recessive to the allele for a normal-sized body (B). This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats. In the image, there are four squares arranged in a 2x2 grid. Each square is labeled with the letter \"b\" in blue, indicating that they are all related to the letter \"b\". The squares are positioned in the center of the grid, making it easier to identify and understand the relationships between them. Additionally, there are two smaller squares located on the right side of the grid, each containing a single blue letter \"b\". Together, these squares form a comprehensive representation of the relationship between the letter \"b\" and the other letters in the grid. Options: (A) 1:3 (B) 4:0 (C) 0:4 (D) 2:2 (E) 3:1 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a normal-sized body or a dwarf body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body size trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a dwarf body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a normal-sized body.nA normal-sized body is the dominant allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the dominant version of the body size trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body size gene. So, offspring with a normal-sized body must have the genotype BB or Bb.nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.nA dwarf body is the recessive allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the recessive version of the body size trait must have only recessive alleles for the body size gene. So, offspring with a dwarf body must have the genotype bb.nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a normal-sized body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a dwarf body. Answer:",

        "Question: Which term matches the picture? Context: Read the text. Invertebrates make up the majority of Earth's living things, but there are many different groups, or phyla, of invertebrates. Jellyfish and sea anemone, for example, are both part of the phylum Cnidaria. Cnidaria comes from a Greek word that means \"nettle,\" a stinging type of plant. Cnidarians are known for the tentacles that surround their mouths, which they use to sting and capture prey. All species that belong in the Cnidaria phyla live exclusively in the ocean. Another phylum of invertebrates found only in oceans is the Echinodermata, a term that comes from Greek words meaning \"spiny\" and \"skin.\" Echinoderms, members of this phylum, have stiff bodies and often have stiff, sharp spines covering their skins. Unlike a cnidarian's wavy tentacles, these spines are used for protection, not to capture prey. The image features a close-up view of a porcupine sea urchin, also known as a spiny sea urchin, perched on top of a rocky surface. The urchin is brown in color, and its spines can be seen protruding from its body, giving it a unique appearance. The background of the image is a blurred blue sky, emphasizing the contrast between the urchin and its surroundings. The presence of the urchin on the rock suggests that it has found a suitable spot to rest and protect itself from potential predators or harsh weather conditions. Options: (A) echinoderm (B) cnidarian Solution: A cnidarian is an animal with a large body and sharp spines. Its spines are used for protection, not to capture prey. Answer:",

        "Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with black fur to offspring with brown fur? Choose the most likely ratio. Context: In a group of rabbits, some individuals have black fur and others have brown fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F). This Punnett square shows a cross between two rabbits. The image depicts a square grid with four squares, each containing the letter \"f\" in blue. The squares are arranged in a cross-shaped pattern, with the top left square containing the letter \"f\", the top right square containing the letter \"f\", the bottom left square containing the letter \"f\", and the bottom right square containing the letter \"f\". The grid is divided into four quadrants, with each quadrant containing the letter \"f\" in a different position. The arrangement of the letters creates a visual representation of the Fibonacci sequence, which is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Options: (A) 0:4 (B) 1:3 (C) 2:2 (D) 3:1 (E) 4:0 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black fur or brown fur, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. The question tells you that the f allele, which is for brown fur, is recessive to the F allele, which is for black fur.nBlack fur is the dominant allele's version of the fur color trait. A rabbit with the dominant version of the fur color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fur color gene. So, offspring with black fur must have the genotype FF or Ff.nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff. These boxes are highlighted below.nBrown fur is the recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. A rabbit with the recessive version of the fur color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fur color gene. So, offspring with brown fur must have the genotype ff.nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff. These boxes are highlighted below.nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with black fur to offspring with brown fur is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with black fur for every 2 offspring with brown fur. Answer:",

Options: (A) a short stem (B) a tall stem Solution: The pea plant's genotype for the stem height gene is hh. The pea plant's genotype of hh has only h alleles. The h allele is for a short stem. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the stem height trait must be a short stem.nTo check this answer, consider whether the pea plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a tall stem (H) is dominant over the allele for a short stem (h). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.nThe pea plant's genotype of hh has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the stem height trait must be a short stem. Answer:",

        "Question: Which term matches the picture? Context: Read the text. A conditioned response occurs when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning. Operant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones. In the image, a woman is sitting on the floor and feeding a small dog. She is holding a piece of food in her hand and offering it to the dog, who appears to be eagerly waiting for the treat. The scene takes place on a white background, emphasizing the focus on the interaction between the woman and her pet. Options: (A) operant conditioning (B) classical conditioning Solution: An animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related is called classical conditioning. Answer:",

        "Question: Based on clues in the text, why would farmers have appreciated cats eight thousand years ago? Context: Read the text about cats. Cats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship. People probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another. It wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way. Later in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous! In the image, a fluffy brown and white cat is perched on top of a fallen tree trunk in a forest setting. The cat is looking off into the distance, possibly surveying its surroundings or searching for prey. The background features a mix of trees and autumn foliage, adding to the serene atmosphere of the scene.

        "Question: Which of the following statements is true? Context: A substance's physical and chemical properties are all determined by its chemical structure. Its chemical structure depends on the number and types of atoms in each of its molecules, as well as on how those atoms are arranged. One property of a substance is its flavor, which is its odor and taste combined. The chemical structure of a substance determines both the kind of flavor it has and the strength of that flavor. Syrups containing flavorants are used to add flavor to snow cones. Substances that have especially interesting and strong flavors are often added to food to change or enhance the food's flavor. These substances are called flavorants. Flavorants can be found in nature, made in a chemical factory, or both. One example of a flavorant is methyl anthranilate. This flavorant is often used to add a grape flavor to syrups, candy, and other sweets. Methyl anthranilate is found naturally in certain types of grapes, but it can also be made by workers in a chemical factory. In the image, a person is holding a blue cup filled with red and blue ice cream. The person appears to be scooping the ice cream into the cup, creating a vibrant and colorful dessert.

Context: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). This Punnett square shows a cross between two horses. In the image, there are four squares arranged in a 2x2 grid, with each square containing two blue lines. The squares are labeled with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, indicating their position within the grid.

The squares are arranged in a symmetrical pattern, making it easy to identify the positions of each number. Options: (A) 1:3 (B) 4:0 (C) 3:1 (D) 0:4 (E) 2:2 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a reddish-brown coat or a black coat, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat color trait. The question tells you that the L allele, which is for a black coat, is dominant over the l allele, which is for a reddish-brown coat.nA reddish-brown coat is the dominant allele's version of the coat color trait. A horse with the dominant version of the coat color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat color gene. So, offspring with a reddish-brown coat must have the genotype LL or Ll.nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype LL or Ll.nA black coat is the recessive allele's version of the coat color trait. A horse with the recessive version of the coat color trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat color gene. So, offspring with a black coat must have the genotype ll.nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ll.nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a reddish-brown coat to offspring with a black coat is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a reddish-brown coat. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a black coat. Answer:",

        "Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with sweet fruit to offspring with sour fruit? Choose the most likely ratio. Context: In a group of muskmelon plants, some individuals have sour fruit and others have sweet fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit taste trait has two alleles. The allele for sour fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for sweet fruit (f). This Punnett square shows a cross between two muskmelon plants. The image depicts a square grid with four squares, each containing the letter \"f\" in blue. The squares are arranged in a cross-shaped pattern, with the top left square containing the letter \"f\", the top right square containing the letter \"f\", the bottom left square containing the letter \"f\", and the bottom right square containing the letter \"f\". The grid is divided into four quadrants, with each quadrant containing the letter \"f\" in a different position. The arrangement of the letters creates a visual representation of the Fibonacci sequence, which is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Options: (A) 4:0 (B) 0:4 (C) 3:1 (D) 2:2 (E) 1:3 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with sweet fruit or sour fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for sour fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for sweet fruit.nSweet fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the recessive version of the fruit taste trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit taste gene. So, offspring with sweet fruit must have the genotype ff.nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff. These boxes are highlighted below.nSour fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the dominant version of the fruit taste trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit taste gene. So, offspring with sour fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff. These boxes are highlighted below.nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with sweet fruit to offspring with sour fruit is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with sweet fruit for every 2 offspring with sour fruit. Answer:",

Options: (A) 0:4 (B) 2:2 (C) 1:3 (D) 4:0 (E) 3:1 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with yellow fruit or red fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for red fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for yellow fruit.nYellow fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit color gene. So, offspring with yellow fruit must have the genotype ff.nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.nRed fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the dominant version of the fruit color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit color gene. So, offspring with red fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow fruit to offspring with red fruit is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with yellow fruit. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with red fruit. Answer:",

        "Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae to offspring with normal antennae? Choose the most likely ratio. Context: This passage describes the antenna type trait in fruit flies: Most fruit flies have a pair of antennae on their head. But, some flies appear to have an extra pair of legs on their head instead! These flies have a mutation, or change, in a gene that affects body development. This mutation makes the cells in the fly's head form mutated antennae that are like legs. In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have mutated antennae and others have normal antennae. In this group, the gene for the antenna type trait has two alleles. The allele for mutated antennae (A) is dominant over the allele for normal antennae (a). This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies. In the image, there are four squares arranged in a 2x2 grid. Each square contains an uppercase letter \"A\" and a lowercase letter \"a\". The letters are positioned in the center of each square, making it easy to distinguish them from one another. Additionally, there are two smaller squares located at the top left and bottom right corners of the grid. These squares contain the letters \"b\" and \"c\", respectively. Overall, the image depicts a visual representation of the difference between uppercase and lowercase letters \"A\" and \"a\". Options: (A) 1:3 (B) 0:4 (C) 3:1 (D) 2:2 (E) 4:0 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with mutated antennae or normal antennae, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the antenna type trait. The question tells you that the A allele, which is for mutated antennae, is dominant over the a allele, which is for normal antennae.nMmutated antennae is the dominant allele's version of the antenna type trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the antenna type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the antenna type gene. So, offspring with mutated antennae must have the genotype AA or Aa.nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype AA or Aa. These boxes are highlighted below.nNormal antennae is the recessive allele's version of the antenna type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the antenna type trait must have only recessive alleles for the antenna type gene. So, offspring with normal antennae must have the genotype aa.nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype aa. These boxes are highlighted below.nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae to offspring with normal antennae is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with mutated antennae for every 2 offspring with normal antennae. Answer:",

        "Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears? Choose the most likely ratio. Context: This passage describes the ear type trait in rats: Some rats have dumbo ears, which are larger and rounder than normal ears. Dumbo ears are also set on the sides of the rat's head instead of on the top. The word dumbo comes from the name of a cartoon elephant whose ears had a similar appearance. In a group of rats, some individuals have normal ears and others have dumbo ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for normal ears (E) is dominant over the allele for dumbo ears (e). This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats. In the image, there are four squares arranged in a 2x2 matrix. Each square contains two letters: E and e. The squares are positioned on a white background, making it easier to see the letters clearly. The squares are arranged in a way that allows for easy identification of each letter. Additionally, there are two blue arrows pointing towards the center of the matrix, indicating the direction of the comparison between the two letters. Overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of the comparison between the letters E and e. Options: (A) 3:1 (B) 0:4 (C) 2:2 (D) 4:0 (E) 1:3 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with dumbo ears or normal ears, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for normal ears, is dominant over the e allele, which is for dumbo ears.nDumo ears is the dominant allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the dominant version of the ear type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ear type gene. So, offspring with dumbo ears must have the genotype EE or Ee.nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype EE or Ee.nNormal ears is the recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the recessive version of the ear type trait must have only recessive alleles for the ear type gene. So, offspring with normal ears must have the genotype ee.nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ee.nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with dumbo ears. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with normal ears. Answer:",

        "Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with a yellow ground spot to offspring with a white ground spot? Choose the most likely ratio. Context: This passage describes the ground spot color trait in watermelon plants: Watermelon plants grow with their fruit resting on the ground. Over time, the bottom of each fruit develops a white or yellow spot called a ground spot. In some types of watermelon plants, the color of the ground spot is an inherited trait. In a group of watermelon plants, some individuals have a yellow ground spot and others have a white ground spot. In this group, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles. The allele for a white ground spot (g) is recessive to the allele for a yellow ground spot (G). This Punnett square shows a cross between two watermelon plants. The image depicts a grid with four squares, each containing the letter \"g\" in blue. The squares are arranged in a cross-shaped pattern, with the center square containing two \"g\" letters and the other three squares containing one \"g\" letter each. In total, there are five \"g\" letters visible in the grid. Options: (A) 4:0 (B) 3:1 (C) 1:3 (D) 0:4 (E) 2:2 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a yellow ground spot or a white ground spot, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ground spot color trait. The question tells you that the g allele, which is for a white ground spot, is recessive to the G allele, which is for a yellow ground spot.nA yellow ground spot is the recessive allele's version of the ground spot color trait. A watermelon plant with the recessive version of the ground spot color trait must have only recessive alleles for the ground spot color gene. So, offspring with a yellow ground spot must have the genotype gg.nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg.nA white ground spot is the dominant allele's version of the ground spot color trait. A watermelon plant with the dominant version of the ground spot color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ground spot color gene. So, offspring with a white ground spot must have the genotype GG or Gg.nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype GG or Gg.nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a yellow ground spot to offspring with a white ground spot is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with a yellow ground spot. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with a white ground spot.

        "Question: Based on the text, how are fruit bats different from most other animals? Context: Read the text about bats. Several kinds of animals \"talk\" to one another in the wild. Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues. Researchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages. What Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another. The researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do. In this image, three large brown bats are flying in the air, with their wings spread wide open. The bats are perched on top of a green tree, creating a vibrant and colorful scene. The bats appear to be in mid-flight, with their bodies stretched out as they soar through the air. The image captures the beauty and grace of these flying mammals, showcasing their agility and aerial prowess. Options: (A) They can communicate with many kinds of animals. (B) They can communicate about specific problems. (C) They can understand some human speech. Solution: These are two ways in which fruit bats are different from most other animals:nThey can communicate with many kinds of animals.nThey can make calls to many kinds of animals.nThe first paragraph states that Egyptian fruit bats are one of the few species that will direct calls to another individual.nThey can communicate with many kinds of animals.nThe first paragraph also states that bats have special sounds for communicating specific issues.nThey can communicate with many kinds of animals.nThe first paragraph also states that bats have special sounds for talking about specific issues.nThese things are not stated in the text:nThey can communicate with many kinds of animals.

        "Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to offspring with bush growth? Choose the most likely ratio. Context: This passage describes the growth pattern trait in rose plants: Climbing growth and bush growth are different growth patterns in rose plants. Rose plants with climbing growth have long, bendable stems that act like vines. These plants may grow upward to cover fences or walls. Rose plants with bush growth stay near the ground. These plants form low bushes or shrubs. In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G). This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants. The image depicts a grid with four squares, each containing the letter \"g\" in blue. The squares are arranged in a cross-shaped pattern, with the top left square containing the letter \"g\" and the bottom right square also containing the letter \"g\". The remaining two squares contain the letter \"g\" as well, but they are located in the top right and bottom left quadrants of the grid. Additionally, there are several smaller blue g's scattered throughout the grid, further emphasizing the presence of the letter \"g\". Options: (A) 2:2 (B) 0:4 (C) 1:3 (D) 3:1 (E) 4:0 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with climbing growth or bush growth, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. The question tells you that the g allele, which is for bush growth, is recessive to the G allele, which is for climbing growth.nClimbing growth is the recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the growth pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with climbing growth must have the genotype gg.nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg. These boxes are highlighted below.nBub growth is the dominant allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the growth pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with bush growth must have the genotype GG or Gg.nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype GG or Gg. These boxes are highlighted below.nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to offspring with bush growth is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with climbing growth for every 2 offspring with bush growth. Answer:",

        "Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with white spots to offspring with solid coloring? Choose the most likely ratio. Context: In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A). This Punnett square shows a cross between two cows. In the image, there are four squares arranged in a cross-shaped pattern. Each square contains an uppercase letter \"A\" and a lowercase letter \"a\". The squares are lined up vertically and horizontally, creating a grid-like appearance. The letters are positioned in the center of each square, making it clear that they are the focal point of the arrangement. Additionally, there are several other letters scattered throughout the image, including \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", \"i\", \"j\", \"k\", \"l\", \"m\", \"n\", \"o\", \"p\", \"q\", \"r\", \"s\", \"t\", \"u\", \"v\", \"w\", \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\". Options: (A) 4:0 (B) 3:1 (C) 1:3 (D) 2:2 (E) 0:4 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with white spots or solid coloring, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. The question tells you that the a allele, which is for white spots, is recessive to the A allele, which is for solid coloring.nWhite spots is the dominant allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cow with the dominant version of the coat pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with white spots must have the genotype AA or Aa.nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype AA or Aa.nSolid coloring is the recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cow with the recessive version of the coat pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with solid coloring must have the genotype aa.nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype aa.nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with white spots to offspring with solid coloring is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with white spots. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with solid coloring. Answer:",

Context: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a gray body and others have a golden body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a golden body (b) is recessive to the allele for a gray body (B). This Punnett square shows a cross between two guppies. In the image, there are four squares arranged in a 2x2 grid, with each square containing a letter and a number. The squares are labeled as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, and Z.

The puzzle appears to be quite challenging, with many letters and numbers involved. Options: (A) 1:3 (B) 2:2 (C) 3:1 (D) 0:4 (E) 4:0 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a gray body or a golden body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body color trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a golden body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a gray body.nA gray body is the dominant allele's version of the body color trait. A guppy with the dominant version of the body color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body color gene.

        "Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings? Choose the most likely ratio. Context: This passage describes the wing type trait in fruit flies: Some scientists breed fruit flies to learn how traits are inherited. These scientists often use flies with vestigial wings, which are shorter and stubbier than normal wings. Fruit flies with vestigial wings cannot fly, so they are easier for scientists to handle and study. In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N). This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies. In the image, there are four squares arranged in a cross-shaped pattern, with each square containing a letter and a number. The squares are labeled with the letters N, H, O, and C, as well as the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. The squares are positioned in the center of the image, making it clear that they are the focal point of the scene. Options: (A) 1:3 (B) 4:0 (C) 3:1 (D) 2:2 (E) 0:4 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with vestigial wings or normal wings, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. The question tells you that the n allele, which is for vestigial wings, is recessive to the N allele, which is for normal wings.nVestigial wings is the dominant allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the wing type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the wing type gene. So, offspring with vestigial wings must have the genotype NN or Nn.nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype NN or Nn. These boxes are highlighted below.nNormal wings is the recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the wing type trait must have only recessive alleles for the wing type gene. So, offspring with normal wings must have the genotype nn.nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype nn. These boxes are highlighted below.nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with vestigial wings for every 2 offspring with normal wings. Answer:",
